                <p class="blog-post-meta">, 2022 by <a href="#">Patricia Crecis</a></p>

                <p> During week 8 I broke down the vacuum_cleaner.py template function by function, to better understand what each one is responsible for and how it all works, I also studied the GUI and HAL.py, I could see how the GUI.py has also rate controlled.
                I started to identify how many threads the vacuum_cleaner.py has and what each one does to then see which one has the highest computational cost and be able to decouple some of them from the template, turning it into an independent process and measuring 
                the performance improvement. I also continued researching on the different possibilities of inter-process communication: there are shared objects; use of queues or pipeline systems and shared memory
                I focused on implementing a prototype with two processes, both of which can access the same shared memory. </p>
