                <p> In my first week I was mainly learning how to use Git, since I had used GitHub for 
                programming in network environments subject but only to store different exercises and projects, so
                I focused on learning how to create branches, issues and patches. </p>
                <p>I became familiar with Git management to be able to work on a real project such as unibotics
                with several repositories on GitHub and with many people working on it, so it was fundamental for me to be able to perfectly 
                know how to create branches and patches so as not to overwrite anyone's work. I also downloaded docker and learned its 
                basics and how Unibotics work with it.
                </p>
                <p> Finally I inspected the RoboticsAcademy repositories</p>
