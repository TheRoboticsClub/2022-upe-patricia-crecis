                <p class="blog-post-meta">, 2022 by <a href="#">Patricia Crecis</a></p>

                <p> In week 3 I focused on continuing to advance with concurrent programming, this time with the multiprocessing 
                module and subprocesses. I created the same small python program
                from week 2 but instead of using the threading module, I used the multiprocessing one. I learnt about the 
                functioning of this module, about processes and how they work in parallel. </p>
                <p> At the weekly meeting, my mentor Jose Mar√≠a explained me the structure of this template and how it works, 
                how each exercise has a template exercise.html and another exercise.py that communicate through websockets (bidirectional communication 
                that allow communication between 2 different languages) one that receives the source code that the user has entered in the exercise, 
                and the other (GUI socket) to communicate with the web browser that allows the visualization, since exercise.py has no graphical interface.
                I started to study and understand the vacuum_cleaner.py template.</p>
                <p> Finally, I started the local deployment of the Unibotics webserver (D1) but I ran into many problems since i work with windows and the recipe was mainly targeted for 
                linux users. </p>
