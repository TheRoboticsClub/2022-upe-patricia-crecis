                <p class="blog-post-meta">, 2022 by <a href="#">Patricia Crecis</a></p>

                <p> In week 3 I focused on continuing to advance with concurrent programming, this time with the multiprocessing 
                module and subprocesses. I created the same small python program
                of week 2 but instead of using the threading module, using the multiprocessing one. I learnt about the 
                functioning of this module, about processes and how they work in paralell. </p>
                <p> In the weekly meeting, my mentor Jose Mar√≠a explained to me a little about the structure of this template and how it works, 
                how each exercise has an exercise.html and an exercise.py templates that communicate through websockets (bidirectional communication 
                controls that allow communication between 2 different languages) one that receives the source code that the user has entered in the exercise, 
                and the other (GUI socket) to communicate with the web browser which allows visualization, since exercise.py does not have a graphical interface.
                I started to study and understand the vacuum_cleaner.py template.</p>
                <p> Finally I started the local deployment of Unibotics webserver (D1) but i ran into many problems as i work with windows and the recipe was directed mainly for 
                linux users. </p>
