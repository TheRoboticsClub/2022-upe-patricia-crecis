                <p> In week 10 I focused in the shared memory prototype, I had some problems because I couldn't access the same shared memory, I tried with buffers but it didn't work either, 
                it gave me an error when I implemented it with multiprocessing, then I consulted with my mentor and it worked for him using Linux. It turns out that Multiprocessing behaves very differently 
                on Windows and Linux so I executed the file inside a docker container and it worked. One process was the writer and it was writing several numbers in the shared memory, at a given frequency and the other
                process, the reader, was reading the numbers that were in the shared memory and printing them in the console, so  both processes have access to the shared memory.</p>
