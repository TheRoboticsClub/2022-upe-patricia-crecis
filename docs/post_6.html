                <p> During my 6th week i focused on the multiprocessing prototype, I measured the number of iterations per second in each
                thread and the time it took for each process to execute. I couldn't see great advantages, because of the two threads 
                of the prototype, one of them finished much earlier than the other, so there was no time to take advantage of executing 
                two threads on different processors (cores), so there was almost no difference in execution time between threading and multiprocessing.
                In order to really see multiprocessing advantages, I used two threads with the same processing and same number of iterations to finish at the same time
                to be able to compare threading with multiprocessing. </p>
                <p> I finished the client side documentation, I created a patch and uploaded it to the repository to make it more complete and robust and facilitate the 
                incorporation of future internship students. <p/>
