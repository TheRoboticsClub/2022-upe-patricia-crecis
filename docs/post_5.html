                <p class="blog-post-meta">, 2022 by <a href="#">Patricia Crecis</a></p>

                <p> During the 5th week, after having practiced with threading and multiprocessing modules, I started a 2-threaded prototype with 
                a high computational load to see if there are really advantages in using multiprocessing. The goal of this is to be able 
                to speed up python processing of exercise.py templates, getting to use processes instead of threads. 
                Thus taking advantage of the different cores of the computer and the parallelism they offer, speeding up execution 
                time and therefore using real parallelism, not the pseudo-parallelism we have now with threads. The main difference 
                is that at the end with threading the different threads are running in the same process (the same core) there are no race 
                conditions, however with multiprocessing each thread runs on a different core and the load is distributed among the 
                different processors. </p>
                <p> I also started to improve the client-side documentation for Unibotics and Robotics Academy, explaining more deeply the protocols 
                between the exercise.py and manager.py with the browser. Explaining how the CODE and GUI websockets work, and the user code processing,
                (compute engine) with the concepts i've been learning these weeks.</p>
