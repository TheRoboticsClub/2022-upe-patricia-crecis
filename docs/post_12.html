                <p class="blog-post-meta">, 2022 by <a href="#">Patricia Crecis</a></p>

                <p> In my last week, I started to work with the vacuum_cleaner.py template to apply everything learnt and convert the current template from using threading to using multiprocessing, 
                taking advantage of the different cores of the computer and the parallelism they offer, speeding up execution time and therefore using real parallelism, not the pseudo-parallelism 
                that we now have with threading.  </p>
                <p> I started by decoupling the HAL.py from the exercise base to have them as parallel processes so that the sensory variables are written from the HAL and read from the brain and 
                the actuator variables the other way around.</p>
                <p> I want to thank my mentor Jose Mar√≠a as he helped me a lot during this months. I learnt a lot from this 
                internship: new technologies such as Docker, frontend and backend communication, computational parallelism 
                and shared memory which I had not seen in the degree, I have improved my Python language, and most important, 
                I experienced working and developing on a real and active platform. </p>
