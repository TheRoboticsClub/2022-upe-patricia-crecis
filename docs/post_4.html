                <p> In my fourth week I was finally able to do the complete local deployment of Unibotics
                Webserver (D1), I was able to solve the different problems I had encountered, and 
                together with one of my teammates we updated the deployment recipe for Windows users in order
                to have a more robust and complete documentation of the D1 deployment for both Linux and Windows.
                 </p>
                <p> I also continued to study and understand the vacuum_cleaner.py exercise, I focused on understanding
                the brain part, how it receives the source code from the user as text (via the code websocket) and puts it to work, how it
                separates the sequential part from the iterative part and works with it and the importance of the so called code
                management, that is: Within the iterative part, the brain measures the time after each iteration, in order to not
                saturate the CPU and maintain a controlled rate of iterations per second to leave the CPU free for other browser tasks.
