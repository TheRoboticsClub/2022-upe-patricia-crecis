                <p class="blog-post-meta">, 2022 by <a href="#">Patricia Crecis</a></p>

                <p> In my 4th week i was finally able to do the full local deployment of Unibotics
                Webserver (D1), I was able to solve the different problems that i had encountered, and 
                together with one of my teammates we updated the deployment recipe for Windows users in order
                to have a more robust and complete documentation of the D1 deployment for both Linux and Windows.
                 </p>
                <p> I also continued studying and understanding the vacuum_cleaner.py exercise, I focused on understanding
                the brain part of the exercise.py, how it receives the user's source code as text (through the code websocket) and puts it to work, how it
                separates the sequential part from the iterative part and works with it and the importance of the so called code
                management, that is: Within the iterative part, the brain measures the time after each iteration, so as not
                to saturate the CPU and keep a controlled rhythm of iterations per second to leave the CPU free for other browser tasks.
