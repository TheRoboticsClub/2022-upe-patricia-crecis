                <p class="blog-post-meta">, 2022 by <a href="#">Patricia Crecis</a></p>

                <p> In week 2, I started to use the Unibotics page as a user to understand how it works, 
                the environment required and the different types of exercises, as well as to learn 
                how to pull the latest RADI image and start a docker container.</p>
                <p> I started to review programming with python, searching information
                about paralell computing to be able to carry out several processes simultaneously in the future,
                since this is an important part of the .py templates of Unibotics exercises.</p>
                <p> I created a small python program with two threads, to practice the threading module,
                one fast thread that gave us a number each second, and the other slower thread gave us a letter each 
                two seconds. Just to practice and get used to work with threads and in the future with processes. </p>
                <p> I learnt also the structure of Unibotics. How D1 is for developers, D2 (test webserver) and D3 
                deployment in production and the current objective of dockerizing D2 and D3 so that these deployments 
                are no longer manual and native but automatic and dockerized. Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CICD) </p>
                <p> Finally I set up this github pages to be able to monitor and write down my weekly work. </p>
